    So far things are a little stressful and not working properly. Sometimes my page is number 7 and sometimes it doesn't show up on any google page, which is all very disconcerting. February 8th was a good day because I was number 2 on the Google search results!
<br/>
    Bing still won't find my page at all. It has about 5 results last time I checked. I submitted my URL to Bing but I have no clue if it worked or not. Maybe the Bing results won't affect me too much.
</p>
<p>
    Check out the currect search results on <a href="https://www.google.com/webhp?sourceid=chrome-instant&ion=1&espv=2&ie=UTF-8#q=mkyaljsk%20vasjkn">Google</a>. 
    I hope to fix this awful tragedy by starting to add other people's links to my webpage in return for them linking to mine. See the list below.

<p>
    I attempted with the other <a href="http://people.tamu.edu/~bailey.bauman/mkyaljsk-vasjkn"> mkyaljsk vasjkn website</a> to have unique information on it but that did not seem to work terribly well. 
<p> 
    In an effort to get this page to rank higher, I am going to talk about similar information to the other people. Hopefully this will result in a higher ranking and thus a better homework grade. The answer to why mkyaljsk vasjkn is so great is simple: life is better with it. You can never have too much mkyaljsk vasjkn. Texas A&M could use some more mkyaljsk vasjkn. SEO contests are extremely worthwhile and you can learn a lot.
